    <p>Sketch symbols are great because they provide one central place to manage components. Buttons are some of the easiest components to create, but like text fields, they have a lot of different states, colors, and styles. So it usually means creating a bunch of different symbols.</p>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Templating frameworks separate the layout of dynamic web sites and applications from the logic that integrates with it. All frameworks support various forms of looping, conditional logic and special formatting. But I also wanted an engine that supported advanced page composition elements, to enable me to share layouts across pages, to include blocks of functionality when required, and to generally make it as simple as possible to construct moderately complex page layouts with the minimum of code and as little duplication of effort as possible.</p>
    <h4>Comparison of template engines</h4>
    <p>There are a number of popular and capable JavaScript templating engines available, and we looked at several of these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>change the width of the line (with additional half-pixel/retina support),</li>
      <li>change the distance from the text,</li>
      <li>(perhaps) have a separate style for visited links.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>npm install express --save<br>npm install nunjucks --save</pre>
    <p>The data() function is used to setup default data for initial rendering of the component, here the data key is setting itself as an empty array as later when we fetch the data it will become and array of objects, and we do not want to break the render by defaulting with invalid data types.</p>
